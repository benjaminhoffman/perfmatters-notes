# Understand Your Customers - Think like eCommerce - Gopal Brugalette
#PerfMatters

## What happens when perf is bad?
- Sales, conversion rates. 2-3s is optimum perf target. Beyond that the rates drop off considerably
- Impacts customer behavior, people give up when itâ€™s too slow
- Think about performance as a major feature of your site, just like functionality
