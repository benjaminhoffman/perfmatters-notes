# The Power of Storytelling - Dawn Parzych @dparzych

- Stories are everywhere
	- Medium, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc. all storytelling platforms
	- Listen to them at conferences, talk about them, etc.
- cognitive biases
	- narrative bias: our brains create a story to help us remember information
	- find the ideas that make your heart sing
	- plot, conflict, setting, characters, theme => story
- four main attributes of empathy (theresa wiseman)
	- ability to take perspective of someone else and see the world as others see it
	- be non-judgmental
	- recognize the emotions that other people are feeling
	- communicate your understanding of that person’s feelings
- K.I.S.S
	- more complicated the information you’re trying to relay, the simpler the language needs to be
	- _Storyteller’s Secret_ book - speeches by influential people like Elon Musk are at 3rd grade language
		- story they want to tell is much more important than the vocabulary
		- variety in how you present information
			- “this sentence has five words. Here are five more words. …”
	- pictures can tell stories
		- make sure your pictures don’t manipulate the information
		- keep your visuals as simple as possible
- stories have certain common elements, rule
	- e.g. rule of 3
	- 3 seconds -> tell a story about a metric
