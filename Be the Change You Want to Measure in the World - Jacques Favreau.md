# Be the Change You Want to Measure in the World - Jacques Favreau
#PerfMatters

## Values
Values mismatch shit gets left out.

## Goals
- unified values, goals map the values into the _measurable world_
- value: developer experience, goal: minimize the time spent waiting on build tasks (lol gulp)
	- up to 12 hours a day waiting on gulp
	- had values, goals, didn’t have continuous measurement

## Values => Goals => Measurement
- There is no “Hidden World”.
- It’s up to us to care
- Not many silver bullets in the performance area, because it’s different per project
- Challenge: write Values / Goals / Measurement
	- tradeoffs
	- what “good” is is entirely related to these three things
- (this sounds similar to SMART goals)
- never stop measuring, otherwise you may not know what you’re leaving out, it could be something you care about
